# Automated-Attendance-System
The system takes attendance by using a camera to capture an image of the student, detect the face, and confirm with the faces in the database. On identification of a registered student face, the studentâ€™s attendance will be marked present. Attendance system, mask detection, and body temperature monitoring are all the combined features of the system.
